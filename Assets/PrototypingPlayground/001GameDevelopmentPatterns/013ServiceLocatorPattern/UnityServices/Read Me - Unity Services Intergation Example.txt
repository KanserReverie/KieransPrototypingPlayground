||Service Locator Pattern|| - Unity Services Example
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityServices.html

This example is using a ||Service Locator Pattern|| to integrate Unity Services.

These services are to be used and referenced anywhere in our project and dont change.

(Also by using interfaces we can swap out testing versions for live ones) - Say we wanted to not use the real advertisement service while developing.

This Pattern allows us to reference and use these services anywhere!
