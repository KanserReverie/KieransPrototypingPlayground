Service Locator Pattern

This can sort of be seen as a Yellow Pages of your classes and dependencies.

It makes dependency management easier but can become a dependency hazard if used incorrectly, making your code more convoluted.

    "If overly used and with the wrong intentions,
    the Service Locator pattern can become a global
    dependency in itself that's arduous to 	manage. 
    Your code will become excessively dependent on it,
    and eventually, it won't be easy to decouple it
    from the rest of your core components."

	~David Baron

Because it creates a global registry only things needed globally should be added.

E.g. A Message Logging System, Analytics System, or Advertisement System might be good to have in your Global Service Locator.

This is because they are:
- Offer a specific service.
- Need to be accessible anywhere.
- Can be changed and not affect gameplay.

We SHOULD NOT use it for say a HUD, UI or Player Stats as they aren't always going to be used or turned on.

BASICALLY, 
ONLY ADD THINGS THAT 
WILL 
OR
SHOULD
ALWAYS BE ACTIVE 
TO |SERVICE LOCATOR|!!
