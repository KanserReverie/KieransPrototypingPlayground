State Machine Pattern
When something can have finite states, you use a state machine.
IMPLEMENTATION METHODS (IN UNITY)
- Concrete Coded States - You code each state and how it moves between them. The difficulty is a visual diagram.
- Unity Animation System - Shows the States but has issues calling things during the states unless with animation events. This does have limitations
- 3rd Party Asset - Recommended as you get the flexibility of the coded states and a visual representation. 
Best is - Node Canvas !! (Play Maker will also work).
