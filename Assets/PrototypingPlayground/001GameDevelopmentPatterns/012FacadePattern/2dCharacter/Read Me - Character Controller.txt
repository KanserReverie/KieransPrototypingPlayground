In this example, we will be using a facade 2 allow us too easily control a character without needing to know the inner workings of it
What the client will see:
A Character Controller Facade that has simple commands that they can call on
What the client can not see:
The movement system to enable moving left and right and jumping
A health system to enable player damage and deaths
A respawn system
