Facade Pattern Implementation

This Pattern needs to be tailor made for each case.
 
Look at this Facade to understand how you could adapt it to your multiple complex classes.

Example

We have a Character Controller that has 3 systems it interacts with.

When we code a player we would only need to interact with the Facade to break up our complex systems.
