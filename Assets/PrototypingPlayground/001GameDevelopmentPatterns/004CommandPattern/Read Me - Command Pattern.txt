Command Pattern
The Command Pattern is a way of treating each:
- “Action” as a  “Commands”

Uses:
- Replay System - Saving the history of “Commands” executed.
- Command Que – Line up “Commands” to execute on a beat.
- Undo System – Save executed commands and undo them on a beat.
- Time Rewind – Make time go backwards by executing commands in reverse. 

+ Removes Actions from code
+ Lets us treat actions as real things
- Makes our code slightly more complex

Check the generic folder for a generic solution on how to implement it.

Also see the examples for how it can be used.
