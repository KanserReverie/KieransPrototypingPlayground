Event Bus Pattern
An Event Bus Pattern is a GLOBAL event pattern.
Event Happens = = > Event Bus = Notifies = > Everything subscribed in the Event Bus to that event

BENEFITS 
Decouples classes linked only for events.
Simple event system.

DRAWBACKS
Creates coupling with the Events Bus itself.
Errors can become harder to find.
Global systems can always be at risk from breaking or being called elsewhere.

USES
Quick Prototypes - Quick games and prototypes of System or Games.
Final Code - If we only need a simple system.
Game Events - Game over, Game starts, Round over.
In Game Events – Light switch on, Team loses a point, Engine blown, Player dies…

TO CREATE
Use the code in this file to create a generic Event Bus and tailor it for your specific case.
