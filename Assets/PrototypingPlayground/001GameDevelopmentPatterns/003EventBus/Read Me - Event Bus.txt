Event Bus Pattern
An Event Bus Pattern is a GLOBAL event pattern.
Event Happens = = > Event Bus = Notifies = > Everything subscribed in the Event Bus to that event

Pros and Cons:

+ Decouples classes linked only for events.
+ Simple event system.

- Creates coupling with the Events Bus itself.
- Errors can become harder to find.
- Global systems can always be at risk from breaking or being called elsewhere.

Uses:
Quick Prototypes - Quick games and prototypes of System or Games.
Final Code - If we only need a simple system.
Game Events - Game over, Game starts, Round over.
In Game Events, Light switch on, Team loses a point, Engine blown, Player dies.

Implementation:
Use the code in this file to create a generic Event Bus and tailor it for your specific case.
