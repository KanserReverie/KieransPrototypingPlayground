Object Pool Pattern
Creating and destroying Game Objects is expensive and can be avoided with an Object Pool.
An Object Pool:
1) Generates a bunch of an objects into a pool.
2) When you need one take one from the pool and activate it.
3) When you are done with it add it back to the pool.

+ Performance boosting
- Unpredictable object states if implemented wrong
- Not always necessary. (Due to computer efficiency and C# memory management)

Implementation
In this case we will be using Unitys Object Pool System IObjectPool<T0> class under the UnityEngine.Pool
