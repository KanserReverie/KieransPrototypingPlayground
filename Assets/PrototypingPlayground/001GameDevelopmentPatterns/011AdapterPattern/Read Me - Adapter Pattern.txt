Adapter Pattern

This is used when you need to adapt old or outside code to a new system BUT do not want to modify the original code.


 -------------
|   Adaptor   |
|   --------  |
|  |Original| |
|  |Class   | |
|  |DoThis()| |
|   --------  |
|   DoThat()  |

Object Adapter – Creates an adapter using an interface. 
Client -> Adapter -> Original Class

Use when we do not have the functions we need.

Class Adapter – Uses Inheritance to create an adapter.
Client -> Interface -> Adapter (Implements Interface, Inherits Original Class) -> Original Class

Use when need to Original Class to work with other classes.

Use When:
- Using 3rd party assets that do not have a function you need.
- Using old code.

Example

Say you have an inventory system, and it saves to cloud but not to local machine.

You could:
       A) Modify the asset (And get merge conflicts on update)
       B) Wait for an update (Chances are they will not add this feature)
       C) Add the function with an adapter and still be able to use the asset.

Look in the "GenericAdapterPattern" folder for an example.
