Spatial Partition
---------------------IDEA---------------------
So I will be dividing this up into 3 layers

Layer One: A single PartitionObject
Layer Two: Row, Column (x,y,z) or Grid of the PartitionObject
Layer Three: A number of Layer 2 Objects together in the (x,y,z) or Grid of the PartitionObject.

The idea is to be able to treat each layer as a single entity buy have access to each layer lower.
