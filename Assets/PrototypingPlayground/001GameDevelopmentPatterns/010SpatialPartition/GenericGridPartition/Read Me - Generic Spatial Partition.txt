This is a Generic "Spatial Partition"

You can create grids of components/(prefabs) if the component is a PartitionBehaviour.

Example:

1)  Make an EnemyCube class, this will be what we want to spawn a grid of.
        public class EnemyCube : PartitionBehaviour<EnemyCube>

2)  To make a grid of an EnemyCube you would make a GridEnemyCubes and drag them on to a GameObject.
        public class GridEnemyCubes : PartitionGridBehaviour<EnemyCube>
    
3)  To make a grid of GridEnemyCube:
        a)  Make another GameObject with a "GridEnemyCubes" Component
        b)  Drag in your First Prefab into it.
        c)  Press Run.

4)  To add logic different at each level:
        a)  Make a new class GridOfGridEnemyCubes 
                public class GridOfGridEnemyCubes : PartitionGridOfGridBehaviour<EnemyCube>
        b)  Add independent features to this class
        c)  Follow Step 3) but use "GridOfGridEnemyCubes" component instead of "GridEnemyCubes"

    
This is a basic implementation and can be expanded on to do stuff with those partitions or store them in an array.
