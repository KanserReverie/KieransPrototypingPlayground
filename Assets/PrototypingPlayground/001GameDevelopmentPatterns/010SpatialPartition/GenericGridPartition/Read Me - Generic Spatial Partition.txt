This is a Generic "Spatial Partition"

You can create grids of components/(prefabs) if the component is a PartitionBehaviour.

Example:

Make an EnemyCube class, this will be what we want to spawn a grid of.
    public class EnemyCube : PartitionBehaviour<EnemyCube>

To make a grid of an EnemyCube you would make a GridEnemyCubes and drag them on to a GameObject.
    public class GridEnemyCubes : PartitionGridBehaviour<EnemyCube>
    
To make a grid of GridEnemyCube you would make a GridOfGridEnemyCubes and drag them on to a GameObject.    
    public class GridOfGridEnemyCubes : PartitionGridOfGridBehaviour<EnemyCube>
    
This is a basic implementation and can be expanded on to do stuff with those partitions or store them in an array.
