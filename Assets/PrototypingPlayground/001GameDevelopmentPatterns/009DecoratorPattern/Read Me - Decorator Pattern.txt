Decorator Pattern

This is used when you need a system that will "Decorate" specific properties of classes.

Think:
- Attachments for weapons - if you take them off the weapon will go back to its normal stats.
- Basic armour – If it increases stats like defence, speed etc.
- Equipment system card game – Will not change base stats but will modify them.
- Dragging a rock – This could modify your speed but only while you are dragging it.

Use When:
- You need to dynamically modify properties without the base changing.
